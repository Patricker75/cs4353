# Flask Hello World Example

This is a simple Flask application that serves a "Hello from server" message.

## Prerequisites

# Setting Up Node.js and npm for React App

To set up Node.js and npm for your React app, follow these steps:

## Install Node Version Manager (nvm)

- On Linux/macOS, you can use the following command to install nvm:

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

- On Windows, download and run the installer from the official nvm GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Install Node.js and npm

Install the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js using nvm:

```shell
nvm install --lts
```

## Verify Installation

To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, run the following commands:

```shell
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

## Create a React App

Now that you have Node.js and npm set up, you can create a React app using the `create-react-app` command:

```shell
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

Replace `my-react-app` with your desired project name. This command will set up a new React project in a directory with the specified name.

## Running the React App

Once your React app is set up, navigate to the project directory and run the development server:

```shell
cd my-react-app
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and your React app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

## React App Routing

In your React app, you can set up routing using the `react-router-dom` library. Here's an example of how you can define routes in your `App.js` file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Login from './Login';
import FuelQuoteForm from './FuelQuoteForm';
import RegistrationForm from './RegistrationForm';
import DataDisplay from './DataDisplay';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/register" element={<RegistrationForm />} />
        <Route path="/fuel" element={<FuelQuoteForm />} />
        <Route path="/display" element={<DataDisplay />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

You can define routes for different components/pages in your app and navigate between them using the `react-router-dom` library.
```

You can save this content to a Markdown file (e.g., `setup-node-npm-react.md`) and use it as documentation or instructions for your project.
